1.  Create a crud app for pets, which has a schema that contains at least four properties

-  Create a github repo for the application
-  make commits after you get something working 
-  start small, start with getting your server running
-  then get the views and routes working
-  then intergrate the db

- Use your fruits app as a reference
- Google your errors, and think about what function is being run when you encounter an error. 

- The final product should have the same functionality as the fruits app
- Don't copy and paste the code, write is so you are developing your muscle memory.

- Share your github link in slack when you are finished
